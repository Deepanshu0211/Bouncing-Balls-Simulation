Features

Dynamic Bouncing: Balls dynamically bounce off the canvas edges, creating an engaging visual effect.

Random Rolling: When balls touch the surface, they start rolling in a random direction, adding an extra layer of realism.

Customizable: The number of balls, their appearance, and physics parameters can be easily customized.

Technologies Used

Matter.js: A 2D physics engine that brings realistic physics simulations to the web.

JavaScript: The simulation is implemented using JavaScript for its versatility and compatibility with web browsers.

HTML5 Canvas: The canvas element is utilized to render the visual components of the simulation.
